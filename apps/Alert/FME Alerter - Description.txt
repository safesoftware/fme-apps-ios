FME Server can now "push" event messages to iOS devices as part of its new Subscription and Notification Services. This Subscriber app provides the ability of iOS users to subscribe to events and receives notifications when an event of that type occurs.

Subscription configuration consists of simply specifying the FME Server address and login information. Subscribers will then see a list of the events that they are able to subscribe.  After the users pick a subscription and taps the Done button, the user is ready to receive messages from the FME Server.

In the FME REST Service, choose the corresponding topic name. In the Notification content, the users can publish a message to the iOS device. 

The message can have four formats:

1. title
e.g. Power Outage

2. title | details
e.g. Power Outage | The power will be restored in 2 hours: www.safe.com

3. title | details | location
e.g. Power Outage | The power will be restored in 2 hours | 49.136793, -122.857178

For case 3., if there is a valid location, the message in the app will display the location as well as a right arrow. Tapping on the message will bring up the map view, with a pin at the location showing the title and the received date.
